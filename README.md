# Automatic Filling Machine 🧪

This project was built during the 1st semester of engineering as a basic embedded systems application. It demonstrates the automation of a liquid filling process using sensors, a microcontroller (Arduino), and a motor/pump system.

## 📌 Objective
To design a simple automatic filling machine that detects the presence of a container and fills it with liquid without any manual operation.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- A sensor detects if a bottle/container is placed at the filling position.
- If detected, the Arduino triggers a relay or motor to turn on the pump.
- The pump fills the bottle for a fixed duration (or until the sensor detects it's full).
- The pump turns off automatically after filling.
